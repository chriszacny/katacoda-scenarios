##Â Task - Conditionals

Start up the python intepreter.

`python`{{execute}}

Create the following conditional check. Remember to indent by four spaces, and that Python does not use braces to denote scope:

```if 1 == 1:
    print('All is well!')
else:
    print('Math is broken')

print('Done.')```
