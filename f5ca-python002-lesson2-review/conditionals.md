##Â Task - Conditionals

If needed, start up the python intepreter.

`python3`{{execute}}

Create the following conditional check. Remember to indent by four spaces, and that Python does not use braces to denote scope:

```python
if 1 == 1:
    print('All is well!')
else:
    print('Math is broken')

print('Done.')
```
