## Sorting

There are two ways to sort a list:

* The sort() method. This modifies the list in place and is only defined on lists.
* The sorted() function. This returns a new list and accepts any type of iterable.

They both accept sorting functions per the **key** parameter; the overall pattern is similar to other languages. 

We will come back to sorting after we cover dictionaries and tuples.
