## Overview

The following exercise was taken from [https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic) and modified to work with python3. 

Read through the exercise in the string1.py file. Then, fill in the functions that are missing code.

Run your code like this: 
`python3 string1.py`{{execute}}

When run, you'll see it test the various functions. Your goal is to change all of the 'X''s in the output to 'OK'.

**TIP:** You can work in the embedded editor, but I'd recommend periodically saving your work to your local machine, so you don't lose what you are doing in case you accidently close your browser.
