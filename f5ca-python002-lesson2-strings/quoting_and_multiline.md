## Task - Quoting and Multiline Strings

Create a string as such:

`a = 'asdf'`{{execute}}

Note you can also do:

`b = "asdf"`{{execute}}

Note: Single quotes are more commonly used. Try to be consistent in whatever choice you pick.

Create a multiline string as such:

```python
s = """ This is the first line
This is the second line
This is the third line"""

print(s)
```
